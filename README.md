# Node-Chat-App
An App for Chatting

This is a faux-chat-room application. I built this app while working through a node.js course at Udemy. The purpose of this app 
was to proivde students with exposure to using Socket.io within an application and deploying it to Heroku. This was by 
far one of the most enjoyable applications to start building. I love the networking side of Operations and using the Socket.io
library was really fun to experiment with in creating this app.
